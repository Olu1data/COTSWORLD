# COTSWORLD
Historical data from Google Analytics and META ads for  Cotswold from  June&amp;July 2025
What’s Working:
• High ROAS & purchases from Cabinetry, Chester, Summer Sale campaigns.
• Direct Response campaigns outperform Brand campaigns overall.
DR campaigns that appear in both charts as high-spend and high-purchase are likely solid performers.
Some campaigns generate decent purchases even with modest budgets these could be candidates for scaling.


 Issues Identified:
• CTR at 0.02 – indicates weak creatives or poor targeting.
• Store Traffic and Brand Awareness campaigns have high spend & impressions, but low conversion.


Revenue and user engagement are trending positively early July outperformed late June across nearly all metrics.
User growth is robust, with signs of improving monetization per user.
Engagement variability suggests a need to fine-tune content or event timing to maintain consistency.
Top-performing events in July are significantly more profitable, indicating what’s working should be scaled.
Risks:Some bubbles in the lower right (high spend, low purchase) signal poor ROAS and wasted budget.
Brand campaigns (BR) appear to be low-cost but also low-impact.
Correlation between higher purchase volume and higher spend, but not the highest spenders
